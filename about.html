        <p>Hi, My name is Robert and welcome to my pet project of a website. <br><br>
            Firstly, my priority here isnt to do another how-to website with tutorials and step-by-step instructions.
             I'm happy to share how I did something, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want more details on a project. 
             My hope is to help you determine if a project is even worth pursuing at all. <br><br>
            So many DIY projects end up being money pits with lack luster results or they are so time consuming and laborious that your pride in the end result 
            is tainted with the thoughts of <em>never again...</em> <br><br>
            Social Media is heavily laden with short clips of 
            <a href="https://www.lovelyetc.com/painted-cabinets-two-years-later-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">poor quality projects</a>  that inspire people to 
            follow through on their own projects. They end up with amature looking results when they were promised a professional quality result. 
            It just looks so easy when it is done in 15 second clips. <br><br>
            This is where I can help. My lack of expertise IS my specialty. I will be working to determine if you shopuld bother doing it yourself, and sharing my shortcomings along the way.
            I am here figuring out just how it is done, and hopefully helping others in their endeavours. 
            My goal is to help weed out what is ACTUALLY worth your time and AVOID poor practices such as painting cabinets with latex paint...

        <p>From Issi, he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to the gates of Cilicia and Syria. This was a double
            fortress: the inner and nearer one, which protects Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a garrison of
            Cilicians; the outer and further one, protecting Syria, was reported to be garrisoned by a body of the
            king's troops. Through the gap between the two fortresses flows a river named the Carsus, which is a hundred
            feet broad, and the whole space between was scarcely more than six hundred yards. To force a passage here
            would be impossible, so narrow was the pass itself, with the fortification walls stretching down to the sea,
            and precipitous rocks above; while both fortresses were furnished with gates. It was the existence of this
            pass which had induced Cyrus to send for the fleet, so as to enable him to lead a body of hoplites inside
            and outside the gates; and so to force a passage through the enemy, if he were guarding the Syrian gate, as
            he fully expected to find Abrocomas doing with a large army. This, however, Abrocomas had not done; but as
            soon as he learnt that Cyrus was in Cilicia, he had turned round and made his exit from Phoenicia, to join
            the king with an army amounting, as report said, to three hundred thousand men.</p>
        <p>From this point Cyrus pursued his march, through Syria a single stage—five parasangs—to Myriandus, a city
            inhabited by Phoenicians, on the sea-coast. This was a commercial port, and numerous merchant vessels were
            riding at anchor in the harbour. Here they halted seven days, and here Xenias the Arcadian general, and
            Pasion the Megarian got on board a trader, and having stowed away their most valuable effects, set sail for
            home; most people explained the act as the outcome of a fit of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus
            to retain their men, who had deserted to him, in hopes of returning to Hellas instead of marching against
            the king; when the two had so vanished, a rumour spread that Cyrus was after them with some ships of war,
            and some hoped the cowards might be caught, others pitied them, if that should be their fate.</p>
