        <p>Hi, My name is Robert and welcome to my pet project of a website. <br><br>
            Firstly, my priority here isnt to do another how-to website with tutorials and step-by-step instructions.
             I'm happy to share how I did something, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want more details on a project. 
             My hope is to help you determine if a project is even worth pursuing at all. <br><br>
            So many DIY projects end up being money pits with lack luster results or they are so time consuming and laborious that your pride in the end result 
            is tainted with thoughts of <em>never again...</em> <br><br>
            Social Media is heavily laden with short clips of 
            <a href="https://www.lovelyetc.com/painted-cabinets-two-years-later-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/" target="_blank">poor quality projects</a>  that inspire people to 
            follow through on their own projects. They end up with amature looking results when they were promised a professional quality in the clickbait title. 
            It just looks so easy when it is done in 15 second clips. <br><br>
            This is where I can help. My lack of expertise IS my specialty. I will be working to determine if you should bother doing it yourself, and sharing my shortcomings along the way.
            <br><br>
            My goal is to help weed out what is ACTUALLY worth your time and money.
            <br><br>
            Something else I will be emphasizing, is working with limitations. I have a single car garage that is multipurposing as my primary workshop, storage for bikes, and skis and seasonal items, and even
            a quiet study area with a desk. <br><br>
            There are some great woodworking channels and how-to's out there, but the majority of projects are out of the scope of the average DIYer. 
            <br><br>
            Sure mister, your solid-walnut dining table built in your humidity controlled wood shop with $50,000 dollars worth of tools looks fantastic. <br>
            But I made <a href="#">mine</a> from scrap lumber and relatively common tools in less than 150 square feet of space for a total expenditure of about $60.
